[ ] change limit switch behaviour from default low to default high if possible

[ ] Implement better limit-switch-event-protocol:
		1. Limit switch detected
		2. Pause for a moment (configurable?)
		3. Reverse at say 1/2 the forward speed (or the minimum speed) until the limit 
		   switch is released (i.e JUST far enough for the limit switch not to 
		   be operated). 

[ ] add #defines which are used to set the drivers specific motor awake or asleep states
	(e.g. sleep = high; awake = low)
	
[ ] add manual clear / auto clear behavior (of the shots taken)

[ ] it would be nice to use max steps and the cycle time to show a 
	calculation of the time to traverse the entire rail.	
	
[ ]	Jog function

[ ]	Add help screens "behind" the action screens describing
	the related function (only if there is flash memory left)
  		
[ ] Tidy up other menu LCD creation steps.

[ ] Move to end (till limit switch).

[ ] Fit IR trigger code in
