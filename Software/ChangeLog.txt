===============================================================================



=====  v1.2  ===  2015-02-23  =================================================

-	bug fixes
-	Improved the motor min-speed code

=====  v1.1  ===  2012-05-06  =================================================

-	added 2 new ramping types -> now 3 motor ramping types 
	(which is bes used can be changed in the code)
	main file line 133) 
	> ARCTAN (new default - much smoother)
	> LINEAR
	> SINUS
- 	added limit switch checks to the motor phases (every 150ms)
-	added check for SELECT key to the motor phases (motor phases are no longer
	blocking)

=====  v1.00 ===  2012-03-22  =================================================

-	fixed a bug with minimum values (backlight time = zero problem)


=====  v0.12 ===  2012-02-13  =================================================

-	fixed a bug in the menu navigation
-	fixed a bug that if on system-time-screen the time is now updated 
	automatically
- 	changed the ramping algorithm - ramping is now much smoother 

=====  v0.11 ===  2012-02-12  =================================================

-	fixed a bug in the menu navigation - in some cases one were
	not able to move away from the main status screen
-	optimized key values (analogue values) for more precise key readings 


=====  v0.10 ===  2012-01-06  =================================================

-	Upgraded MiniE to be compatible with Arduino 1.0
-	Fixed link to new Arduino 1.0 jeelabs RTC Lib 
- 	Extended limit switch slightly where it will reverse the motor and
  	run one load of steps in the reverse direction to stop limit switch
- 	Lowered the detection for the limit switches (from 1023 to more than 1000)
- 	Reduced strings used to lower sketch size, Arduino 1.0 ended up blowing
  	the size out by 200bytes, pushign it over the UNO & ATMega328p limit
- 	Created new function to fill out menus to reduce code size (Could still be
  	extended to include other menus)


=====  v0.9 ===  2011-10-09  ==================================================

-	Added documentation for v0.9


=====  v0.9 ===  2011-09-21  ==================================================

-	Added units to the different setting-screens
-	Menu positions are now saved. When you go back in a menu, the focus is
	placed on the item you were at before
-	Added two 1k resistors to the two limit switch pins to generate clear
	signals (see circuit diagram for more details) and avoid unwanted
	limit-switch-triggerings
-	Added the possibility to enable/disable limit switches in the software	
-	Added the possibility to set min and max motor speeds (step delays:
	big delay = slow; short delay = fast)
-  	Fixed the issue that focus line did not close after program end and 
	during motor home movement


=====  v0.8.1 ===  2011-09-14  ================================================

-	Minor bugfix (system time editor)


=====  v0.8 ===  2011-09-13  ==================================================

-	The "P" for existing programs on the main screen is now only
	displayed if there are programs that will become active in the future.
	(smart "P")
-	Added a motor post delay
-	The system time is now editable
-	Updated copyright information
-	Fixed an issue that led the engine to heavy lagging while starting and
	stopping the continuous mode
-	Fixed a bug that crashed the engine in continuous mode after a limit
	switch event


=====  v0.7 ===  2011-09-07  ==================================================

-	Continuous mode is now 100% precise
-	Cycle length can now be adjusted in 0.5 second steps
-	Fixed a bug in motor-home counting
-	Fixed crashed motor ramping from version 0.6


=====  v0.6 ===  2011-09-06  ==================================================

-	Extensive optimisations of the UI code regarding RAM usage
-	Added RTC functionality
-	Added the possibility to create up to 30 programs
	(single date programs, repeating weekday programs)
-	Programs can be saved / autosaved together with the settings
-	Deleted "load settings" (useless because settings are automatically 
	loaded during boot)
-	Added "reset settings" functionality. This resets all settings to
	factory default and deletes all programs.
-	Added message system to allow pop-up screen messages
-	Bugfix of a limit switch error that allowed one more cycle with triggered
	limit switch when restarting the engine
-	Minor bugfixes, code- and usability optimisations	


=====  v0.5 ===  2011-08-29  ==================================================

-	Fixed the motor pin error (exchanged pin 12 & 13 to fit the circuit 
	diagram)
-	added EEPROM functionality for saving and restoring all settings
-	Optimized menu code (in preparation for the RTC-program feature coming)
-	Added max shot limit
-	Added max motor step limit (counting from motor home)
-	Added backlight control features (duration and brightness)
- 	Minor bugfixes
-	Moved limit switch pins to analog pins 3 and 4


=====  v0.4 ===  2011-08-26  ==================================================

-	Minor code optimizations
-	Optimized long-key-press speed up
-	Added limiting switches check to analog pins 4 and 5. 
	When connected to 5V the program stopps
-	Added the motor-home counter for the continuous mode - motor home now
	works in continuous mode too
-	The number of shoots done now stays displayed after the program stopped
-	Fixed an error in home counting in shoot-move-shoot mode


=====  v0.3  ===  2011-08-19  ==================================================

-	Changed the default value for focus line behavior to low with shutter
-	Implemented motor sleep functionality (new menu entry in "Motor")
	(motor is always in sleep while program stopped)
-	Added resistors in front of the optocouplers and updated the circuit
	diagram	


=====  v0.2  ===  2011-08-18  ==================================================

-	Camera focus was implemented and is executed before the
	camera exposes (new menu entry under "Camera")
-	"Focus behavior" was implemented. This is setting the behavior
	of the focus line while exposing (high or low) (new menu
	entry in "Camera")
-	Added a little documentation describing "the cycle" of miniE			


=====  v0.1  ===  2011-07-06  ==================================================

First version with the following features:

-	Arduino (ATMega) based Motion Control system 
	for use with the DFRobot LCD Shield
-	System control is fully implemented as a 5 button - 
	16x2 char GUI
-	Supports 1 stepper motor
-	Supports 1 camera
-	Shoot-move-shoot mode 
-	continuous mode (needs to be improved)
-	Sinus shaped motor ramping (up to 32 mio steps)
-	Auto backlight-off after 15 seconds 
	(still hard wired in the code)
- 	Motor home (for shoot-move-shoot mode)
-	Exposure post delay
