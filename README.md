Notice regarding compilation
----------------------------

The legacy code does not compile with the newest Arduino SDK! Please download the Arduino SDK version 1.0.6 from here: 

http://arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases

This should compile the code just fine. You will also need to install the RTC library for being able to compile and upload the sketch. Details how to do that can be found in the documentation folder of this repository.
